# Credit Risk Analysis and Prediction
This project is my final task in Virtual Internship at ID/X Partners. In this project I classified the borrower into a good and bad borrower. The model built with logistic regression and used SMOTE technique to overcome the imbalanced data. The model evaluated using ROC curve and resulted 98% accuracy.
